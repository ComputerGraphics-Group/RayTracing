        Introduction

      <div class="content">
        So far, we have gotten the initial grasp of how OpenGL works, so we can confidently experiment with our own original code. By the end of the previous assignment, we had already learnt quite a bit
        about 3D manipulation through our browsing and exploration of OpenGL so we could immediately go ahead with projection without fear. In fact, by the time we actually checked the assignment details, it turns out that
        we had already completed almost all the requirements mentioned! Now we can go through each step in the process.

      Moving to 3D

        We already tried out making primitive triangles in a three-dimensional setting, so we decided to start out with a cube due to its simplicity. We simply needed to set the appropriate vertices and enable z-buffer depth testing
        for a correct model to be displayed.

        By all accounts this is pretty boring, so we decided to spice it up with some color.

        Now we can try out some more exotic shapes and angles.

        By this point we were already getting tired of seeing the same boring angle without actually seeing the 3D object fully. To remedy this we decided to take the assistance of a useful tool called ImGUI
        that would allow us to adjust values in realtime in a GUI inspector. This was a great move on our part and it remained useful through the rest of the project.

        Now that that was done, we decided to start off with some good camera actions to interact with the scene properly.

      Camera movement and the projection/model/view system
    </div>
    <div class='content'>
      <div>The mechanism of movement is simple: instead of moving a physical camera or viewport around, you simply move the entire world around your camera. That involves changing the world angles and directions based 
      on your input. The way we achieved this is to make a Camera class which stores every single datapoint we need for a Camera to function such as direction vectors and the 3 main angles - Yaw, Pitch and Roll. Then
      we make a driver function that continuously updates these vectors every frame of input.
